#    First letter is the molecular weight bin - a measure of size - horizontal axis, left to right, online. A: 200 D, B: 250, C:300, D: 325, E:350, F: 375
#    Second letter is the logP bin - a measure of polarity - vertical axis, top to bottom, online.
#    The third letter is reactivity : A=anodyne. B=Bother (e.g. chromophores) C=clean (but pains ok), E=mild reactivity ok, G=reactive ok, I = hot chemistry ok
#    The fourth letter is purchasability: A and B = in stock, C = in stock via agent, D = make on demand, E = boutique (expensive), F=annotated (not for sale)
#    The fifth letter is pH range: R = ref (7.4), M = mid (near 7.4), L = low (around 6.4), H=high (around 8.4).
#    The sixth and last dimension is net molecular charge. Here we follow the convention of InChIkeys.
#        Thus. N = neutral, M = minus 1, L = minus 2 (or greater). O = plus 1, P = plus 2 (or greater).
